                                             <p>The main feature of the Susi:ai app is to provide a conversational interface to provide intelligent answers using the loklak/AskSusi infrastructure. The app also offers login functionalities to connect to other services and stored personal data. Additionally the application uses data provided by the user's phone to improve Susi answers. Geolocation information for example helps to offer better answers related to questions about "things nearby".

                                             <ol>

                                        <p><center><img src="./img/editing.png"  height="40%" width="40%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>

                                                 <li>Editing for this image is not available (When changing the wallpaper):</li>
                                                 <p>When i try to change the wallpaper it give me an error that says "Editing for this image is not available" instead of this error it should have a cropping feature built-in for editing the images.</p>
                                                  <p><center><img src="./img/7.jpg"  height="40%" width="40%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
                                                 <li>Internet connectivity problem (happens most of the time):</li>
                                                 <p>I get internet connectivity problems most of the time , it seems like it isn't able to connect to its susi_server api. This needed to be fixed asap!</p>
                                                  <p><center><img src="./img/2.jpg"  height="40%" width="40%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
                                                 <li>An error occured, please try again (this also happens 90% of the time):</li>
                                                 <p>I think its the same problem, it is not able to connect to its susi_servers api.</p>
                                                  <p><center><img src="./img/token susi.png"  height="100%" width="100%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
                                                 <li>Add token : "***********" line below the password reset link also:</li>
                                                 <p>When i try to reset the password i get an email having a reset link containing the token but the app has the feature to reset the password but its need the token code. i too when clicked the link got a page for changing the password but along with the link it also should have the token code separately so that i can copy it and paste it in the app when changing the password through the app.</p>
                                                  <p><center><img src="./img/6.jpg"  height="40%" width="40%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
                                                 <li>I ask questions in english and get answers back in another language (happens some of the time):</li>
                                                 <p>This happens sometimes but instead of getting answers back in another language it would be great if we a language selecting option in the settings page.</p>
                                             </ol>

                                             <p>
                                                 <ol>
                                                     <li>Proper Multi-language support:</li>
                                                     <p>Instead of getting replies back in other languages , it would be great if it having a proper multi language support.</p>
                                                     <li>Contextual based learning:</li>
                                                     <p><center><img src="./img/1.jpg"  height="40%" width="40%" class="img-responsive"></center></p>
                                                     <p>It should have a proper contextual based learning. for eg. if i am telling the ai that my friend name is sam, and after that i say he is 6ft tall, the ai should automatically know that i am talking about my friend.
                                                     Note: If you need more help with this topic please bookmark this page i'll add more info for improving the app regularly.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <li>It should be able to provide data when asked for it by using some seaerch engine api or scrapping the websites if needed:</li>
                                                     <p>If the user needs to go to a shopping complex and he/she ask for the location, the app should be able to provide that data using any map service providers api (for eg. open map's api)</p>
                                                     <li>It should try to get the conversation going but not by asking random question in between a conversation about a particular topic:</li>
                                                     <p>second main problem with the app currently is that it asks random questions in between a conversation about a particular topic. This feature needs to be improved asap.</p>
                                                     <li>It should have basic service integrated like telling the time, date etc. :</li>
                                                     <p>Though it shows the date but when asked by the user it is not able to tell time, date etc.</p>
                                                     <li>Should have a web search service integration:</li>
                                                     <p>It should have a web search service integrated for giving user proper answers for day to day questions. It seems like it has one but it is not quite fuctioning properly.</p>
                                                     <li>Word recognition is average:</li>
                                                     <p>When the user asks something it is not able to recognise most of the time what user is asking though sometime it answers a quote or random fact related to that but that is not required. A proper convlutional neural network based model is highly required here.
